Here we will talk about the Syntax of the CSS 

A CSS rule set contains a Selector and a Declaration block.

Now the question arise what are selector and a declaration ?

Selector: It Indicates  the HTML element you want to style. It can be any tag like <h1>,
<title>, <body> etc.

Declaration: The declaration part contains the declarations seperated by a semicolon.
Each delaration contains a property name and value, seprated by a colon.

Let's consider previos example only:

h1{
  background-color : lightblue;

  colour : blue;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
}
 The text which we type here as "h1" is the 'selector' , furthre there also another "p".
 The "color" , "text-align" ,"font-size" are the 'property' which we write in a declaration.
 And the last but not the list is the "blue","cneter","50px" are the 'value' .
 
 When we combine the above all the three we make a declaration block.
 
 The actual syntax of declaration seems like as follow:
 Selector{Property1: value1; Property2: value2; ..........;}
