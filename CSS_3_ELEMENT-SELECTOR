<!-- The element selector selects elements based on the element name.

p{
  text-align: center;
  color: green;
}

like in above example 'p' is the element and it will apply the changes or 
we can say the conditions to make web page attractive .

similary if I add a new tag like 'h2' so in same way I have to add the element 
selector for that particular purpose. 

so let suppose i upgrade the html file as 

-->


<html>
<head>
<style>
h2 {
 text-align:center;
 color: red;
 font-size: 30px;
} 


p{
  text-align: center;
  color: green;
}

</style>
</head>
<body>
