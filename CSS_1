/* About CSS:
1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
2) It provides the additional features for html.
3) It is use for giving style of web pages and user interfaces.
4) With the help of the CSS we can add the new look to old html documents.
5) With minor change in CSS you can change the look of whole website.

Advantages of using CSS:
1) Solevs a bigs problems:

In html we used to write tags for defining font, color, background style, element
alignments, border and many more. So that become a very long process when you are 
making huge website , so in case to avoid a lot of hardwork, we used CSS.

2) Saves a lot of time:

In CSS definations and commands are store in external file so if you want to change 
something just change the things in the external files and you will apply it all over 
the website.

3) Provides more attributes:

It gives us detailed attributes as compared to html to give the feel for the website.
